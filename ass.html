    <h2>The Concord School</h2>
    <p>Children at our Prep School are happy.  They are happy because they enjoy every lesson.  They are fully engaged in a range of exciting programs and activities.  And they are taught by people who are genuinely interested in them and know them really well.

 

        Pastoral care is outstanding. Itâ€™s centred on the class teacher who spends a great deal of time with their pupils. We can call on a host of other experts and resources if needed. With everyone keeping an eye out for your child you can be sure that that they are in the best possible hands.
